Never accidentally send emails to real people from your staging environment.

Rails example
-------------

Send all staging emails to a group email address without accidentally emailing
users with active email addresses in the database.

In `Gemfile`:

    gem 'recipient_interceptor'

In `config/environments/staging.rb`:

    Mail.register_interceptor RecipientInterceptor.new(ENV['EMAIL_RECIPIENTS'])

From the command line:

    heroku config:add EMAIL_RECIPIENTS="staging@example.com" --remote staging

Options
-------

Optionally prefix the subject line:

    Mail.register_interceptor RecipientInterceptor.new(
      ENV['EMAIL_RECIPIENTS'],
      subject_prefix: '[STAGING]',
      subject_list_recipients: true
    )
